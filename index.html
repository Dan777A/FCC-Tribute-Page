  <h2 id="headings">Biography</h2>
  <p>Formed in Los Angeles in 1983, the Red Hot Chili Peppers quickly gained attention due to their energetic, creative and often erratic live performances. The groups music spans genres but can generally be described as funk-inclined rock with psychedelic and punk influences aswell. commercial mainstream success came in 1991 with the release of their album <i>Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magick</i>. Since this release the band have become one of the best-selling bands of all time at over 80 million records. Even though the lineup of the band has changed many times over the years, somehow they have still been able to churn out consistently great music. My favourite era of the band was between 1998 and 2009, which was the second period of time that John Frusciante was with the band as guitarist. During this period the albums <i>Californication</i> (1999), <i>By the Way</i> (2002) and <i>Stadium Arcadium</i> (2006) were produced. These 3 albums were the most commercially successful of the bands albums and 3 of my favourite albums of all time.</p>
